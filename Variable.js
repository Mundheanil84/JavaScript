
// “var” Keyword in JavaScript
// var is a reserved keyword that is followed by a reference variable name, and the name defined after the keyword can then be used as a pointer to the data in memory.
// var is the oldest method used as a variable declaration in JavaScript. Let's declare a variable and initialize it by assigning a value to it with the help of the assignment operator (=):

// Declaration and initialization
var name = "John Doe";

// Declaration
var name;
// Initialization
name = "John Doe";
